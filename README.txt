This app adds support for Philips TV's models ranging from ~2014 up to at least 2019 using the Jointspace protocol. Older models might need to manually enable this.

Use this app to create useful flow like "Dim the lights when Netflix is opened".


There are still some unresolved issues in the pairing process. These are very hard to resolve, if you are experiencing these issues and want to contribute please contact me.
